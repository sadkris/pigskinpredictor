# Pigskin Predictor
- A weekly NFL predictions game

My first foray at making an actual functional web application, the site is chiefly a small project for personal development.

The aim is to produce a predictions game whereby people simply pick weekly game winners, including a weekly road team banker, and score points based on the outcomes of the games.

The site uses python scripts to pull schedule and result information from NFL XML feeds, turn them into application-compatible JSON, and import the data into the back-end database via Django imports.

Scoring is all automated and the tables are updated weekly, based on the real-life results.
